                        A convenient one-day trip if you’re stationed in Colombo, Sitawaka River is located adjacent to Kithulgala, and is only a 90-minute ride from the capital. Featuring grade four and five rapids, the turbulence of the initial sections of the river are contrasted with the calm middle portion, you can use this time to absorb the lush landscapes of the forests that encompass the river. The final section of the river picks up on the rapids, with grade 3 and 4 torrents likely being in your way.

                        Prioritise your safety above all else, and research the reputation of the rafting tour operators before selecting one. It is recommended that you do not embark on the more dangerous waters before you’ve accumulated prior experience navigating canyons and rafts. Make sure to wear comfortable clothing that is quickly drying when on your journey, and the equipment provided by the guides are a must.
